## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### For Developers
**Quick Reference:**
```javascript
// Toast API
showToast('Message', 'success|error|warning|info', timeout);

// Cart API
addToCart(id, name, price, type);
removeFromCart(itemId);
updateQuantity(itemId, delta);
getCart();
calculateTotals();
```

**Debug Commands:**
```javascript
// Browser console
console.log(cartManager.getCart());
console.log(cartManager.calculateTotals());
localStorage.clear(); // Reset
```

### For QA Team
- Use `QA_MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for testing
- Report issues with browser, OS, and console errors
- Test on real devices when possible

### For Support Team
Common user issues:
1. Cart not persisting → Check if cookies/localStorage enabled
2. Toast not showing → Check browser console for errors
3. Badge wrong count → Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
